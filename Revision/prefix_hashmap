Common problems that use mp[0] = -1
Problem	Explanation
Longest subarray with sum = K	Need correct length from index 0
Longest subarray with sum = 0	Need to count full-array sums
Contiguous Array (0s & 1s)	Prefix sum must detect full-prefix balance
Longest subarray of equal 0s and 1s	Your problem



When do we use: mp[0] = 1 (or 0 → 1 count)?
This happens in a completely different type of problem:
✔ Used in:
Counting total number of subarrays that satisfy a condition.
✔ Typical goal:
Count how many subarrays have sum = K
(not the longest one).
✔ Why 1 ?
Because:
Before starting, prefix_sum = 0
That counts as one occurrence of prefix_sum = 0
Every time current prefix_sum - K = 0, we add this count.

You are NOT computing lengths.
You are computing how many times something happens.

🔹 Problem types:

Count number of subarrays with sum = K

Count subarrays with sum divisible by M

Count subarrays with XOR = K (variation)

Count nice subarrays (# of odd numbers)

Example:

Count number of subarrays whose sum = 0.

If prefix_sum becomes 0 at index 1, we want to count that as a subarray:

mp[0] starts at 1, meaning prefix_sum 0 seen once before.




Putting it all together
Goal	Use	Why
Longest subarray	mp[0] = -1	Need correct length from index 0
Count of subarrays	mp[0] = 1	0-sum appears once before start → counting works

Final one-line summary:
Use mp[0] = -1 when finding the longest subarray (length problem).
Use mp[0] = 1 when counting how many subarrays exist (frequency/count problem).
